### About

Hello random person! I want to share with you my newest creation, Catapult. Catapult is a game launcher build entirely in Microsoft's WinForm .NET Framework. I made Catapult because i got sick of seeing all of the other absolute garbage sites out there that either give you a virus or require you to visit like 3 / 4 different ad sites to use them. 

Why should cheaters have to pay to get a game? Catapult is completely free to use (and open source)! If you see something broken or something that you feel should be improved feel free to open up my code and give it some tinkering, that's the whole point after all!

## FAQ

Go on the issues and spam.

#### It wont open when I run it!

You most likely left your antivirus enabled, or forgot to configure it to ignore Catapult. If you don't have a third-party antivirus installed, read the section below on how to disable Windows Virus and Threat Protection.
